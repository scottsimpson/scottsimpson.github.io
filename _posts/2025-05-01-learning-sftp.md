My new course, _Learning SFTP_, covers the basics of using SFTP to transfer files between systems securely. SFTP is a feature of most SSH servers, and it allows us to work with files without setting up a separate file sharing solution.

> "In this course, instructor Scott Simpson explores the essentials of securely transferring files between computers using SFTP. Find out how SFTP leverages SSH to provide a secure method for file transfers. Learn how to set up and connect to servers, navigate file systems, and perform file operations like uploading, downloading, and managing permissions. Understand the differences between command line and graphical clients, and find out how to choose the best tools for your workflow. Gain skills in troubleshooting connectivity issues and handling file permissions. Plus, enhance your understanding of network security, and explore different server configurations, including cloud and on-premises setups. By the end of the course, you will be able to effectively and securely manage file transfers across various environments."
