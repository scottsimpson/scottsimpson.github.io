My new course, _Learning Linux Command Line_, covers the basics of working with the text-based shell on a Linux system. What's it all about? Check out the description below:

> “Having a basic understanding of the command line is critical for any Linux administrator and in this course, experienced author Scott Simpson covers the basics of the command line. Scott shows you how to set up and navigate through the file and folder structure, and how to set permissions. He then discusses some of the common command line tools, such as grep, awk, and sed, as well as common command line apps. He concludes the course with a look at how to work with archives and how to perform some basic system management tasks. Check out this course to get an intro to the Linux command line and set a foundation for more advanced Linux topics.”
