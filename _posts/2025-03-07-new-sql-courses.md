LinkedIn Learning recently released six of my new challenge-based SQL courses. Test your skills with common SQL operations like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and various schema management tasks. Then, spend some time with real-world, hands-on scenarios where you'll manage database operations for a restaurant and a library.
