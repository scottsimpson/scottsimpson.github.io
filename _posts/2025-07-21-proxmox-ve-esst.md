My new course, _Proxmox Virtual Environment Essential Training_, gets you up to speed with Proxmox VE, a popular platform for hosting virtual machines and Linux containers. What's it all about? Check out the description below:

> "Proxmox VE is an open-source virtualization platform for running and managing virtual machines and containers. Its convenient web interface allows extensive control over guests, and it supports many useful features like high availability, software-defined networking, backups, and more. In this course, independent content creator Scott Simpson guides you through what you can do with this versatile platform. Go over installation and setup, then dive into creating virtual machines and containers. Learn how to manage guests via the web UI or the CLI, as well as how to expand guest storage, map a directory to share files, connect to a guest via SSH or RDP, and much more. Plus, explore effective ways to manage networking and high availability. This course prepares you to work efficiently in a Proxmox virtual environment."
