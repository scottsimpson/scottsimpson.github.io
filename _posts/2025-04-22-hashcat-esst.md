My new course, _Hashcat Essential Training_, covers the basics of using [hashcat](https://hashcat.net) to recover passwords from hashes.

> "Get up and running with hashcat, the popular password cracking and recovery program. Hashcat supports more than 300 hashing algorithms, and is regularly used by security auditors to assess the robustness of a password during pentesting tasks. With support for computation using modern GPUs and the ability to coordinate cracking efforts across multiple nodes, hashcat brings speed and scale to our password recovery sessions. Join instructor Scott Simpson as he outlines the core concepts and skills you need to get started with this powerful tool. Along the way, test out your new know-how with practical challenges designed to help you take your ethical hacking to the next level."
