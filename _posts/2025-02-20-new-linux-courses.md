Two of my new courses have just been released on LinkedIn Learning!

These courses, _Ubuntu Linux: Essential Commands and System Administration_ and _Ubuntu Linux: Providing Services_, cover the basics of setting up and running an Ubuntu Linux system.

[Ubuntu Linux: Essential Commands and System Administration](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/ubuntu-linux-essential-commands-and-system-administration) starts with the basics and introduces the fundamentals of working with a Linux system from the perspective of a user and an administrator.

[Ubuntu Linux: Providing Services](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/ubuntu-linux-providing-services) demonstrates how to set up and configure common services like HTTP, DNS, routing, SMB, and more.
